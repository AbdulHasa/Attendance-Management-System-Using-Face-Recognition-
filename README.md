# Attendance-Management-System-Using-Face-Recognition-
This project is an efficient and secure system for marking attendance using face recognition technology. It detects and identifies faces in real-time and logs attendance automatically into a database. Built using Python, OpenCV, and a face recognition library, it simplifies traditional attendance processes.
